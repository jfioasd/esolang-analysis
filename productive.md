# 1. Develop a suitable to-do list

To-do lists usually fail because we complicate them or add activities that aren’t equally important. Others won’t require any time at all, some tasks will take a long time. As a result, there is a mismatch in how we spend our time. The result is that our to-do list turns into a means of avoidance. Yes, that is true because when we accomplish simple things, we become really confused while doing difficult things.

Don’t lie; you’ve done that before. So then, you need to manage your to-do list better.
# 2. Set small goals for the tasks

The scope of each new project or assignment may seem too large. But as soon as you start researching it and understand what can be done, you’ll see how each part builds upon the other.

Your project can be divided into more reasonable goals, which is one of the easiest and most useful things you can do.

    What pieces and assets are required?
    Who do you need to talk to first?

Before setting deadlines, break down the most important information, and then predict how long it will take you to complete each task.

You will be able to understand what is being asked if you realize the scope of the need, put the necessary steps into place, and then calculate the time required. Sometimes a project that seems large won’t take very long.
# 3. Focus on one goal at a time

As we just discussed, you should develop the practice of setting small goals for tasks. The project outline in the section above should have helped you identify the most crucial tasks, but how does your company decide what’s crucial?

The final decision will be made by your team, however, you can monitor OKRs, KPIs, and other measures to show productivity. It is up to you to carry out whatever the top priority of your organization is. Check out the 90-90-1 rule. It also applies to leading a team.
# 4. Do the hardest thing first

It can be tempting to avoid difficult tasks and focus on quick results. However, you can improve your drive and focus for the rest of the day by completing your most difficult tasks first.
# 5. Stop multitasking

While we’re talking about focusing on one activity or objective at a time, let’s also discuss multitasking. Even though it’s simple to become confused and attempt to multitask, doing this really reduces your productivity.

We are getting increasingly tired and working less effectively because of the continual job switching. Switching and changing that frequently requires a lot of brain power. When Slack, Skype, and Salesforce are all competing for our attention, the modern workplace environment won’t help you in your effort to be more focused.

# 6. Take a break

It can seem strange to advise taking breaks when discussing how to be productive at work, but taking regular breaks really lowers stress and increases productivity. Many workplaces require that workers take regular breaks. But if you work from home or in an unmonitored office, you may want to schedule short breaks every few minutes for 10–15 minutes.
