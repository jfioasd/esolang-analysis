# esolang-analysis
1-byte command order for several esolangs used on CGCC.

I only did the analysis on the esolangs that I'm interested in, so that
I'll include the builtins that will be the most useful/powerful for my esolangs,
thereby making them easy to program in. So I only did analysis on golflangs and some fungeoids.

If you have heard of any other language that I can analyze, tell me, and I might analyze the language's frequencies if I'm interested enough.

So you can use this as a reference for some of the design patterns of popular esolangs on CGCC.

You can also use this repository to look for builtins that are highly used across
several golflangs, or self-help while designing your esolang.
