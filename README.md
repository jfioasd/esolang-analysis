# esolang-analysis
1-byte command order for several esolangs used on CGCC.

I only did the analysis on the esolangs that I'm interested in, so that
I'll include the builtins that will be the most useful/powerful for my esolangs,
thereby making them easy to program in. So I only did analysis on golflangs and some fungeoids.



You can also use this repository to look for builtins that are highly used across
several golflangs.
