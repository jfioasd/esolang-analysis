* You can pack many operations in one byte, but the
corpus will only reflect the most useful operation
packed in there.

* Overloading does not actually help much to reduce instruction space,
since the operations overloaded usually operate on types that are
not common in golf. About 1/2 savings for number of instructions packed
in overloads.
